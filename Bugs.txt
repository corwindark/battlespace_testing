To add:
[ ] Separated rooms are deactivated, and not targeted


Things to fix in demo code
[ ] Move to two different 'req step' varibles, one for each player, so 
first row can be relative
	[ ] But make sure the loops are synced after each pass through the board
[ ] don't add to 'req step' if no cells in row
